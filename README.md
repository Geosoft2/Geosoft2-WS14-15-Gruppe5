# GeoRate #
## Introduction ##

**GeoRate** is a community driven geo-ressource commenting platform with a vast scalabilty for different geo-data-formats. It´s completely written in JavaScript and relies on the MEAN-Stack. The whole system is very easy to set-up because of the use of Vagrant.

The Project is part of the course "Geoinformatic 2" at the Westfalian Wilhelms-University of Münster (Germany) and was developed by Ba. Sc. students.

The developer-group (Group-5) consits of the following members:


- Marc Dragunski
- Jan van Zadelhoff
- Boris Stöcker
- Fabian Weber
- Daniel Ummelmann
